            Anyone who has tried to install a backyard putting green quickly
            gains an appreciation for how hard it is to be professional
            greenskeeper. As if building a putting green was not hard enough,
            maintaining one can be a full-time job. These challenges extend to
            the tee boxes and any others areas where divots makes growing grass
            a constant battle.
